Only return the signature and comment of the class/functions which have a comment.
Ignore any class/functions which don't have a comment.
Then put them in a simple list which looks like this
(replace <<SIGNATURE>> with the signature, replace <<COMMENT>> with the comment):
<RETURN>
<<COMMENT>>
<<SIGNATURE>>
</RETURN>
<RETURN>
<<COMMENT>>
<<SIGNATURE>>
</RETURN>

An example of a <RETURN> is:
<RETURN>
/**
    * This is the MoneyController class which handles API requests related to hours.
    */
    @Authenticated()
    @Controller('api/hours')
    export class HourController {
</RETURN>
<RETURN>
/**
   * Retrieves the months data based on the provided week year and week number.
   *
   * @param weekYear - The year of the week.
   * @param weekNumber - The number of the week.
   * @returns The data for the specified week.
   */
  @Get('week/:weekYear/:weekNumber')
  getWeek(@Param('weekYear') weekYear: number, @Param('weekNumber') weekNumber: number) {
</RETURN>

Now go and do it for the following code:
${code}
