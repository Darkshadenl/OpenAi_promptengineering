Your job is to improve comments.
If a comment does not align with the relevant code, then improve the comment.
Never change the code itself.
If a whole class is provided with multiple comments in different places,
only ever return the improved comment with the first line of code which follows the last line
of the comment (this should normally be the signature of the class or function).
Place every return in a separate return tag duo (<RETURN>result</RETURN).
If a comment was already valid, just ignore it and don't return it.
All comments should be in english.

In the end you should produce and endresult that looks like this:
<RETURN>
/**
   * Retrieves the months data based on the provided week year and week number.
   *
   * @param weekYear - The year of the week.
   * @param weekNumber - The number of the week.
   * @returns The data for the specified week.
   */
  @Get('week/:weekYear/:weekNumber')
  getWeek(@Param('weekYear') weekYear: number, @Param('weekNumber') weekNumber: number) {
</RETURN>
<RETURN>
/**
   * Retrieves the months data based on the provided week year and week number.
   *
   * @param weekYear - The year of the week.
   * @param weekNumber - The number of the week.
   * @returns The data for the specified week.
   */
  getWeek(@Param('weekYear') weekYear: number, @Param('weekNumber') weekNumber: number) {
</RETURN>


As you can see, there's not actualy implementation code included. Just the function name,
and any decorators between the comment and the signature.
Now go and do it for the following code:
${code}
