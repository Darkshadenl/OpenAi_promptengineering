Your task is to extract all comments from the given code.
Each line has a line number. If a comment spans multiple lines,
then I want to know all the line numbers.
I also want to know the complete comment.

This:

/**
This is the MoneyController class which handles API requests related to hours.
*/
Would result in:

|Line|Number Range|Comment
|------------------|---------|
|32-34| /**\n* This is the MoneyController class which handles API requests related to hours.\n*/\n  |

What are comments?
They are pieces of text in the code that are indicated by certain characters.
In this case, it's /** and */.

I'd like to receive your results in a similar table.
Go ahead for the following code:
${code}
