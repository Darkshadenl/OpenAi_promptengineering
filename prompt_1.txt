Write a doc comment for the Typescript code.
I will provide you with complete typescript files.
It's up to you to find appropriate places to write doc comments.
The form of the comment should look like these examples:

Example 1:
/**
 * AdminController is responsible for handling administration-related
 * requests. It accesses the system services and data stores to perform actions
 * such as restarting the system, managing events, etc. This controller is
 * specifically designed for use by administrators and requires appropriate
 * authorization for access.
 *
 * Note that every request requires an authenticated user and some methods require a specific
 * user role (e.g. administrator).
 *
 * Each request is logged for auditing and debugging purposes.
 *
 * @param {RestartService} restartService - Service for restarting functionality
 * @param {EventStore} eventStore - Store for event data and operations
 * @param {TraccarAdapter} traccar - Adapter for Traccar device operations
 */

Example 2:
/**
 * UserManagementController is designed for handling user account management
 * tasks. It interacts with user models to facilitate operations like creating,
 * updating, and deleting user accounts. Additionally, it handles user authentication
 * and authorization, ensuring secure access to user data.
 *
 * Note that most methods require the user to be authenticated and some methods are
 * accessible only by users with specific roles (e.g., administrator, moderator).
 *
 * User activities are logged for security and auditing purposes.
 *
 * @param {UserService} userService - Service for handling user-related operations
 * @param {Authenticator} authenticator - Service for authentication and security checks
 * @param {Logger} logger - Logger for tracking user activities
 */


Example 3:
/**
 * InventoryController is responsible for managing inventory data and operations.
 * It provides functionalities for tracking product stock, updating inventory records,
 * and generating inventory reports. It is designed to be used by warehouse managers
 * and inventory clerks.
 *
 * Access to the controller methods is role-based, with specific actions requiring
 * different levels of access rights (e.g., clerk, manager).
 *
 * Inventory updates and transactions are recorded for future reference and audit trails.
 *
 * @param {ProductService} productService - Service for managing product details
 * @param {StockManager} stockManager - Manager for stock level operations
 * @param {ReportGenerator} reportGenerator - Tool for generating inventory reports
 * @param {NotificationService} notificationService - Service for sending inventory alerts
 */


Return comment including the code.
Do not surround with ```typescript ```.
Alright. Now write a doc comment for this class:
