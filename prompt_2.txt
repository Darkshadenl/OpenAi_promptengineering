Now that we have the comments,
I want you to check if the comment still matches the code it is associated with.
In this case, the comment is the guiding factor. If the comment no longer matches, please update it.
Provide me with the same table as before, but add a column indicating the reason why you changed the comment.

This would look like this:
|Line Number Range|Updated Comment|Change Reason|
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
